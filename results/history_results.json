    "Question": "What is the Silk Road, and why is it sometimes referred to as the Silk Routes?",
    "Standard answer": "The Silk Road is neither an actual road nor a single route. The term instead refers to a network of routes used by traders for more than 1,500 years, from when the Han dynasty of China opened trade in 130 B.C.E. until 1453 C.E., when the Ottoman Empire closed off trade with the West. Although the trade network is commonly referred to as the Silk Road, some historians favor the term Silk Routes because it better reflects the many paths taken by traders.",

        "Answer": "The Silk Road was a network of ancient trade routes that connected China with the Mediterranean region, stretching from the 2nd century BCE to the 15th century CE. It was called the Silk Road because Chinese silk was a highly prized commodity traded along this route. The term \"Silk Routes\" is often used instead, as it was not a single road, but a collection of routes that branched out and connected various regions, facilitating the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between East and West.",

    "Standard answer": "It is hard to overstate the importance of the Silk Road on history. Religion and ideas spread along the Silk Road just as fluidly as goods. Towns along the route grew into multicultural cities. The exchange of information gave rise to new technologies and innovations that would change the world. The horses introduced to China contributed to the might of the Mongol Empire, while gunpowder from China changed the very nature of war in Europe and beyond. Diseases also traveled along the Silk Road. Some research suggests that the Black Death, which devastated Europe in the late 1340s C.E., likely spread from Asia along the Silk Road.

As a mathematician, her precise calculations of orbital mechanics were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. manned spaceflights. Johnson's most notable contributions include calculating the trajectory for Alan Shepard\u2019s historic flight in 1961, America's first human spaceflight, and verifying the computer-generated flight paths for John Glenn\u2019s orbit around Earth in 1962. Her work also played a pivotal role in the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon in 1969. Her calculations helped ensure safe crew launches and returns, thereby bolstering the reliability and success of U.S. space missions.",
